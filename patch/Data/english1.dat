I thought opening your mind and soul was a good thing?"(ELDEST: Yes, in fact, it's crucial."bHowever, people have tried to use that power for evil.

Anyways..."yThey believe that history is destined to repeat itself, so they are trying at all costs to stop that from occurring."\VENAM: So you're saying that "Storm-9" is eventually going to happen again in our time?"†IRVIN: Correct.

We shall return to the future and do what we must."CVENAM: But how is training people going to help with anything?"eMELIA: We believe that someone is trying to recreate what happened.

Steam[Ò0"‘Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger."‹To support its bulb, Ivysaur's legs grow sturdy. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, the bud will soon bloom into a large flower."‘Venusaur's flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people."—The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is happy, and blazes when it is enraged."Without pity, its sharp claws destroy foes. If it encounters a strong enemy, it becomes agitated, and the flame on its tail flares with a bluish white color."˜A Charizard flies about in search of strong opponents. It breathes intense flames that can melt any material. However, it will never torch a weaker foe."žIts shell is not just for protection.
